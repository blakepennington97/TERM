## Description of Experience
1. Beth, a pregnant woman, is recruited into the TERM program.
2. A nurse will meet with Beth for the first time.
3. In this first meeting, the nurse will begin developing a relationship with both Beth and her social support network.
4. Health and psychosocial assessments will be conducted.
    - These will be used as parameters for Beth's Maternal Health Plan (MHP) goals
5. A MHP is developed to satisfy Beth and her family's needs.
